## Short Bio

I am now a first-year Ph.D. student in Dept. of ECE, <a href="https://ualberta.ca" target="_blank">University of Alberta</a>, supervised by <a href="https://malei.xyz" target="_blank">Prof. Lei Ma</a>. I received my M.Eng of Electrical and Computer Engineering with specialization in ML&AI from <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a> in Dec 2020, B.Eng of Telecommunication Engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (<a href="https://english.bupt.edu.cn/" target="_blank">BUPT</a>) in Jun 2019. During undergraduate I got a chance to work with <a href="https:/bmchen.net/" target="_blank">Prof. Ben M. Chen</a>, and spent a happy 3 months at <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank">National University of Singapore</a>.
